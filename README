Pyxrand 0.0.3

=======

Python script for shuffling pixels in images (either by-pixel with variable randomness or in variable cluster sizes with invariable randomness).

Deps: matplotlib, scipy, scikit-image 
WARNING: The script uses a patched scikit-image function (skimage.util.montage.montage2d) and will not work on machines not having that script locally linked. The patch is pending in upstream.

Non-free image files excluded via .gitignore. Please contact the project leader for advice on how to acquire suitable images.
